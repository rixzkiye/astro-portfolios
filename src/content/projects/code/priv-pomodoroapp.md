# Modern Portfolio Website

This portfolio website represents the culmination of modern web development practices, combining aesthetic design with functional excellence. Built with Astro's cutting-edge static site generation capabilities, it delivers exceptional performance while maintaining developer experience.

## 🚀 Features

### Performance First
- **Lighthouse Score 95+**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals
- **Static Generation**: Pre-rendered pages for instant loading
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic WebP conversion and lazy loading
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only interactive components are hydrated

### Design Excellence
- **Dual Theme Support**: Seamless light/dark mode switching
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Micro-animations**: Subtle interactions that enhance UX
- **Typography**: Carefully selected font pairings (Inter + Playfair Display)

### Content Management

- **Markdown Support**: Rich content authoring with MDX
- **SEO Optimized**: Automatic meta tags and Open Graph support
- **Sitemap Generation**: Automated XML sitemap creation

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The website follows Astro's Island Architecture, where interactive components are selectively hydrated:

```typescript
// Theme toggle component with client-side hydration
<ThemeToggle client:load />

// Static components remain server-rendered
<ProjectCard {...projectData} />
```

### Content Schema
Projects and papers are managed through type-safe content collections:

```typescript
const projectsCollection = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    category: z.enum(['code', 'music', 'video']),
    // ... additional fields
  }),
});
```

### Styling Strategy
Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling with custom design tokens:

```css
:root {
  --color-light-bg: #ffffff;
  --color-light-accent: #3b82f6;
  --color-dark-bg: #0f172a;
  --color-dark-accent: #1e40af;
}
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Light Theme**: Clean whites with soft blue accents
- **Dark Theme**: Deep grays with warm gold highlights
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Headings**: Playfair Display for elegance
- **Body Text**: Inter for readability
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono for technical content

### Animation Strategy
Subtle micro-interactions enhance the user experience without overwhelming:
- Hover states with smooth transitions
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Loading states with skeleton screens

## 📊 Performance Metrics
